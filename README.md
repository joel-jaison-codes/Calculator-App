# Dark Mode - Basic Calculator App (Python Tkinter)

A clean, responsive **desktop calculator application** built using **Python and Tkinter**, designed to replicate a modern smartphone-style calculator interface. This practice project helped me learn basics of practical GUI design, event handling, and object-oriented programming in Python.
